I think it sets the unsecure IPA as destroyed and make the realm access the destoryed area.
And then it will raise the fault and the RMM will be trapped and map the unsecure region to
unsecure IPA. may be by asking the host to remap unsecure map RMI Cause it is already 
destoryed but mapped to the unsecure IPA.
