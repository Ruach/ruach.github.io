    Ruach (Hebrew <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMaNEurciu8" title="ruach_pronunciation">[רוּחַ]</a>)
</h4>

Ruach is the Hebrew word translated as breath ([Ezekiel 37:5-6][5]) and wind 
([John 3:8][4]) in the Scripture. In the context 
of Christianity, it is commonly interpreted as a representation of the 
[Holy Spirit][3] ([Genesis 1:2][2]).

  My Confession-Study Hard to Give
</h4>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Initially, my educational journey was driven by the desire to use the knowledge
I gained to benefit others. However, as I immersed myself in the world of 
research, I quickly realized that academic research is fiercely competitive, 
often demanding significant physical and mental dedication. In this challenging 
environment, there's a persistent concern that my time and efforts will be 
primarily assessed based on the publication. Additionally, the pressure of 
graduation further exacerbated my worries. 
This shift in perspective led me to place greater importance on results rather 
than practicing kindness, compassion, and empathy towards others. Consequently,
I found myself repeatedly making unattainable and insincere commitments to 
assist others once I reached significant milestones. However, upon achieving a 
particular milestone, the time and effort I had invested in attaining it became
so precious. Moreover, I started to believe that all my opportunities and 
knowledge were solely the result of my own efforts and that I deserved them. 
Once this mindset took hold, I completely lost sight of my initial goals and 
developed a strong reluctance to share what I had gained with others.
However, I have now come to understand that this privilege was not solely the 
outcome of my personal endeavors but was also graciously bestowed upon me. I now
realize that if these commitments are not gradually put into practice in daily 
lives, it can be challenging to uphold them after reaching those milestones. 
I aspire for this blog post not to come across as a boast about my knowledge but 
rather to offer a small but meaningful assistance to anyone who may find it helpful.
I would like to end my confession by sharing my most cherished Bible verse.
